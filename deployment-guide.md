## Testing Your Deployed App

### Important: HTTPS Requirement
- Your app **MUST** be served over HTTPS to access location services
- All recommended platforms provide HTTPS automatically
- Local testing (`file://`) won't work for GPS features

### Mobile Testing
1. Open your deployed URL on your mobile device
2. Allow location permissions when prompted
3. Test in different scenarios:
   - Walking
   - In a car (as passenger)
   - Different weather conditions

## Troubleshooting

### Location Not Working?
- Ensure you're using HTTPS (not HTTP)
- Check browser permissions for location access
- Try different browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox)
- Test with mobile data vs WiFi

### App Not Loading?
- Check all files are uploaded correctly
- Verify file names match exactly (case-sensitive)
- Look at browser developer console for errors

### Performance Issues?
- Test GPS accuracy in open areas (not indoors)
- Allow time for GPS to get accurate location
- Consider device GPS capability differences
