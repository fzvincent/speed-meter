- **Location Services**: Access to device location data with position accuracy information
- **Motion Analytics**: Calculate and display:
  - Current speed (km/h or mph)
  - Maximum speed achieved
  - Average speed
  - Total distance traveled
  - Trip duration
- **GPS Information**: Display altitude, coordinates, and location accuracy
- **Mobile-Optimized**: Responsive design specifically tailored for mobile devices
- **Offline Capability**: Works without internet connection once loaded

## Technical Requirements

- Modern web browser with GPS/location services support
